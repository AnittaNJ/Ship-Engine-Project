# Ship-Engine-Project

Issues with engines could lead to engine malfunctions, potential safety hazards, and downtime (e.g. delayed deliveries), resulting in the breakdown of a shipâ€™s overall functionality, consequently impacting the business, such as affecting revenue via failure to deliver goods. By predicting timely maintenance, the business aims to increase profit by reducing downtime, reducing safety risks for the crew, limiting fuel consumption, and increasing customer satisfaction through timely deliveries.
